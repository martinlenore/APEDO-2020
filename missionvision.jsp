				<li><h4>General Introduction<h4></li>
				
				<li><p>We investigate the complex interactions between biopolymers peptides, proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and carbohydrates in order
				to understand cellular physiology at the molecular level. Our research at URI has focused on using solid-phase peptide
				synthesis (SPPS) to prepare diverse combinatorial libraries of both naturally-occurring and engineered peptides for
				further study. We have designed antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) based upon pleurocidin, isolated from Winter Flounder,
				 to combat the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic microbes, and topoisomerase inhibitors
				based on natural products for use in cancer chemotherapy. Our bioanalytical chemistry research has involved the development
				of novel methods for monitoring dynamic properties of peptides, proteins, lipids and DNA using capillary electrophoresis (CE),
				circular dichroism (CD), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The molecular modeling/bioinformatics research
				area aims to expand the application of molecular mechanic techniques in order to model dynamic processes
				in the biopolymers we investigate.</p></li></br>
				<li><p><h4>Creating AMPed<h4></p></li>
				<li><p>Our database is created to have all the related information about the Antimicrobial Peptides so that it can serve as a hub for
				researchers. Data curation is the difficult phase of creating database which takes time and effort. We are on high road
				to make efforts for collaboration around the world with researchers having same research field to collect data which in turn
				will help in experiments, creating and using tools for better outcome. Gradually updating every aspect of database as needed.
				We aspire to be as “Brenda database” is for Enzyme, "AMPed" for Antimicrobial Peptide.</p>
